This study aims to improve the detection and reporting of phishing emails and URLs using a semi-supervised learning approach. This machine learning technique is advantageous in situations where acquiring large amounts of labeled data is difficult or expensive, as it utilizes both a small set of labeled data and a larger pool of unlabeled data.

Phishing, primarily executed through deceptive emails and malicious websites, is a significant cybersecurity concern. Key statistics indicate that 96% of phishing attacks happen via emails, with a smaller percentage through harmful websites. The study highlights alarming trends in phishing and ransomware attacks, including:

- A surge in new phishing and scam pages in 2020, totaling nearly 7 million.
- A 171% increase in the average ransom payment from 2019, reaching approximately $312,493.
- A significant rise in phishing attempts, particularly a 510% increase from January to February 2020.
- The COVID-19 pandemic led to a 20.7% increase in online transactions in 2020, coinciding with a 40% rise in ransomware attacks and a 600% increase in email malware attacks compared to 2019.

The study emphasizes the growing success of social engineering attacks, a primary cause of security breaches in corporate networks, and highlights the crucial need for improved phishing detection to mitigate the direct and indirect costs, such as legal and reputational damages, associated with these attacks.

The objective is to leverage semi-supervised learning to enhance phishing detection and reporting, addressing a critical cybersecurity need. The primary dataset for this project includes webpages from PhishTank, which have been extensively preprocessed for analysis and model training. Due to time and resource constraints, the model is trained on a selected subset of this dataset. This research represents an important step in combating the increasing threat of phishing and enhancing cybersecurity measures.
